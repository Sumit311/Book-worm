          <strong>  1. What are e-books?</strong><br>

            An e-book is a digitally expressed narrative containing text and other media. Many e-books are electronic
            versions of printed books; increasingly authors and content creators are creating e-books with no print
            analogues. Most current e-books exist as packages that can be read on computing devices using a
            browser-based application or on a dedicated e-reader device. Some e-books are enhanced and include indexes,
            dictionaries, maps, video, and geolocational or interactive elements such as simulations as an integral part
            of the book. Most e-book distribution platforms permit bookmarking and annotations. At this time, the
            majority of trade digital books that public libraries typically acquire do not presently have these
            features.
            <br><br>
        <strong>2. How many libraries provide e-books?</strong>
            <br>
            In 2011 two-thirds of U.S. public libraries offered e-books, up from 38 percent only two years before.
            According to Library Journal, 60 percent of libraries that do not currently offer e-books expect to within
            two years. (Source: LJ/SLJ Virtual Summit: eBooks at the Tipping Point, October 2010.)
            <br><br>

        <strong> 3. Why do libraries offer e-books?</strong>
            <br>
            Public libraries have established relationships with their communities that begin when parents bring their
            very young children to the library to read books, and these relationships continue through adulthood. Many
            readers have purchased dedicated reading devices or multipurpose computer tablets and expect the public
            library to offer e-book downloads as an extension of print library lending. As people age and eyesight
            diminishes, e-books offer users the ability to enhance the reading experience by adjusting font size and
            screen background. Print disabled users have an opportunity to gain access to millions of works previously
            unavailable to them. Library users want books in regular print, large print, audiobook and e-book formats.
            Libraries want to offer the user the right book, in the right format at the right time. E-books are now part
            of that service.
            <br><br>

        <strong>4. What advantages do e-books offer over traditional print books?</strong>
            <br>
            E-book readers are compact; a single -book reader can hold thousands of traditional text based e-books.<br>
            E-book readers are lightweight and portable<br>
            Using the most common lending technologies, users do not incur overdue fines because e-books “time out” on a
            patron’s reader at the end of the loan period.<br>
            Patrons do not have to come to the library to access and download e-books.<br>
            E-book readers and browsers are more effective in meeting the accessibility needs of library users with
            print disabilities. Many have built-in screen readers, screen enlargement options and text-to-speech
            functionality.
            <br>E-books do not require shipping and physical processing like traditional print books, saving staff time
            and money.
            <br>When an e-book is returned, it goes back into circulation immediately with no time spent waiting for the
            user to return it. E-books spend no time in a book drop waiting to be checked in and no time waiting to be
            shelved. And there is nostaff time or cost required for check in, check out, or shelving — not to mention
            shelf reading!
            <br>E-books do not require shelving like traditional print and at some point this may reduce library capital
            costs.
            <br>There is a definite “cool factor” associated with e-books.<br><br>

            <strong>5. What are the disadvantages of e-books?</strong>
            <br>
            Not all titles are available in digital format.<br>
            Not all publishers are releasing digital simultaneously with print.<br>
            Libraries cannot easily select which titles they would rather have in digital format at the time of
            publication.<br>
            Libraries often pay a premium (hosting fees) for e-books rather than getting a discount from vendors for
            quantity purchases of print books.<br>
            Current reading experiences are enhanced with e-book readers, which may not be affordable for everyone.<br>
            Most current e-book retailers and distributors use proprietary digital rights management (DRM) software to
            control access to the e-book.<br>
            A standardized file format for e-books is still evolving, although EPUB dominates, with EPUB3 likely to see
            widespread adoption.<br>
            E-book use statistics usually cannot be tracked within the library ILS system.<br>
            Licensing terms of use for e-books may restrict user rights under the copyright law, such as library lending
            and fair use.<br>
            There are significant reader privacy concerns.<br><br>

           <strong> 6. How do libraries acquire e-book service?</strong><br>

            Some libraries provide the service as individual libraries, while others participate in a consortium which
            leases the books. Most libraries use a vendor that hosts a site to manage the e-books and the portal that
            library patrons use to borrow the e-book. There are also several sites online that offer free e-books
            directly from authors, publishers or genre based interest groups.
            <br><br>


        <strong> 7. What impact does a vendor’s platform have on e-books?</strong><br>

            The procedures for downloading vary, which makes it more difficult for libraries to offer and support e-book
            service to the public. A library user may be unable to access and download e-books that are offered only in
            a propriety format that requires the use of a particular e-reader.
            <br><br>

        <strong>8. Do libraries loan e-book readers?</strong><br>

            Some libraries do, but this lending model might not be sustainable in the long term, and the legal issues
            remain unclear. Readers can be broken or stolen and their replacement adds financial burden to libraries. As
            reader technology evolves, libraries have to purchase new readers supporting new features and formats.
            Traditionally, public libraries have focused more on providing the content rather than the appliance;
            readers are likely to fall in price, making it less necessary for the library to provide readers.

            <br><br>
        <strong> 9. Which e-book reader is best?</strong><br>

            It all depends on what the reader is seeking and what the customer is willing to pay. E-book readers vary in
            weight, screen size, resolution and digital rights management controls. Library patrons are reading e-books
            on a variety of other electronic devices (phones, computers, and other handheld devices.) The types of books
            a reader likes will also have bearing on the device they choose. Novels and nonfiction that are primarily
            text are well suited to black & white e-readers; while full-color or graphics-intensive books, such as
            children’s and lifestyle books, are best presented on multi-function tablet-style devices and computers.
            <br><br>

        <strong> 10. How are libraries responding to patrons’ questions regarding e-book readers?</strong><br>

            Libraries are working hard with the public to help them understand the new technology and how to use it.
            Staff help the public make sense of the complicated ebook and e-book reader market place by offering
            instructional classes and tip sheets that provide information on how to make various e-book formats work on
            the patron’s particular reader. Libraries also provide public access computers with Internet connections
            that facilitate access to digital books.
            <br><br>

        <strong>11. What would libraries offering e-books like to see happen in the future?</strong><br>

            Interoperability of e-book readers and platforms so that all library e-books could be downloaded to any
            device.<br>
            The option to purchase rather than to lease e-books, in much the same way libraries purchase print books,
            audiovisual, and other materials.<br>
            Full integration of e-books into library catalogs so that the vendor’s site is transparent to the user.
            <br>Integration of e-book usage data into the ILS circulation module so that there can be a single place to
            generate circulation statistics for both print and digital material.
            <br>Integrated acquisitions workflow so that e-books can be selected and made available to patrons through
            the established materials ordering process.
            <br>Vendor collection development programs for digital materials that mirror programs now used for physical
            materials acquisitions, such as new title notifications plans and standing order programs.
            <br>Reasonable pricing models comparable to those given on traditional print books. [For a nice desiderata

        <strong> 12. Where do libraries acquire e-books?</strong><br>

            Many e-books are available free online. For more information on this subject go to:

            <br><br>
        <strong>13. What privacy issues are there related to e-books?</strong><br>

            New reader privacy issues emerge with digital book services. Reading history can be collected and analyzed
            and wind up in the hands of governments or third parties without the reader’s knowledge or consent. This
            information may be used for targeted advertising. Libraries have strict reader privacy policies supported by
            state privacy law. The need for an updated federal privacy law in wake of the new digital environment is
            currently being considered by Congress.

            <br><br>
        <strong>14. How long will they be allowed to be on your shelf without re-buying?</strong><br>

            This varies by vendor and publisher. In some cases there is a cap on the number of circulations. In others
            there is no limit. The supply chain is still in the process of establishing viable models.
            <br><br>

        <strong>15. Can you use bookmarks?</strong>
            <br>
            In most cases, yes.
            <br><br>

        <strong> 16. Is the cover image available?</strong>
